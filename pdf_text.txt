Safcha Internal Dashboard — Technical Specification  
Confidential — Page 3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
 
1. Executive Summary  
This document provides the complete technical specification for the Safcha Internal Company 
Dashboard — a centralized web application that consolidates all business operations, data 
tracking, team management, and strategic planning into a single, role -based platform.  
 
1.1 Purpose  
Safcha currently manages operations through a Notion workspace with 1 5+ disconnected 
sections, external spreadsheets (CRM, pricing), PDFs, and manual processes. This creates 
fragmented visibility, duplicated data entry, and difficulty tracking real -time business metrics 
across sales, inventory, production, and finance.  
The new dashboard will replace and consolidate all of these into a unified system that provides 
real-time business intelligence, streamlined workflows, and role -based access for every team 
member.  
 
1.2 Key Objectives  
• Centralize all company data into one pl atform with a single source of truth  
• Provide real -time KPI tracking across sales, inventory, production, and finance  
• Automate interconnected workflows (e.g., new order → inventory deduction → 
production queue → financial update)  
• Enable role -based access so  each team member sees exactly what they need  
• Replace fragmented Notion pages, spreadsheets, and PDFs with structured, searchable 
databases  
• Support both Arabic and English for internal operations  
 
1.3 Current Pain Points Being Solved  
Pain Point  Current Sta te Dashboard Solution  
Data fragmentation  Notion + Excel + PDFs + Zoho 
scattered  Single unified platform  
No real -time visibility  Manual updates, outdated 
numbers  Auto-calculated live KPIs  
Inventory blind spots  Separate Notion page, no alerts  Real-time stock with auto -deduction  
Financial tracking  Separate tracker + pricing doc  Integrated P&L with margin analysis  
Safcha Internal Dashboard — Technical Specification  
Confidential — Page 4 CRM scattered  Zoho + Excel + Notion lists  Built-in CRM with pipeline stages  
Team coordination  Tasks spread across pages  Centralized task system with assignments  
Onboarding difficulty  Multiple PDFs and docs  Guided workflows within dashboard

2.3 Authentication & Role -Based Access  
Every page and API route must check user permissions. The system should support granular, 
section -level access control.  
 
Role Dashboard Access  Permissions  
CEO / Admin (Aziz)  Full access to everything  Read/Write/Delete all modules, 
manage users and roles  
Operations Manager 
(Malik)  Operations, Inventory, Tasks,

a module, specific actions (create, edit, delete, export) should also be permission -gated.  
  
Safcha Internal Dashboard — Technical Specification  
Confidential — Page 7 UX/UI DESIGN GUIDELINES  
 
3. UX/UI Design Guidelines  
The dashboard must feel premium, clean, and intuitive. The target aesthetic is a modern SaaS 
dashboard with warm, earthy tones that reflect Safcha’s brand identity (palm, sand, nature). 
Below are detailed design directives.  
 
3.1 Design Principles  
• Clarity over decoration: Every element must earn its place. No decorative clutter.  
• Progressive disclosure: Show summary first, let users drill into details. Don’t 
overwhelm with data upfront.  
• Consistent patterns: Same layout patterns for similar data types (all list views, all detail 
views, all forms).  
• Mobile -aware: While primarily desktop, the layout should not break on tablets. Key 
metrics should be viewable on mobile.  
• Bilingual -ready: Support RTL layout for Arabic. All text should be tr anslatable. Keep UI 
labels short.  
 
3.2 Color System  
Token  Hex Value  Usage  
--primary  #1A1A2E  Sidebar, headers, primary buttons  
--accent -gold #E8A838  CTAs, highlights, active states, Safcha brand  
--accent -green  #2D6A4F  Success states, positive metrics, inventory OK  
--accent -red #D32F2F  Alerts, negative metrics, low stock warnings  
--bg-main #F5F5F0  Main content background (warm off -white)  
--bg-card #FFFFFF  Card backgrounds  
--bg-sidebar  #1A1A2E  Sidebar background (dark)  
--text-primary  #333333  Body text  
--text-secondary  #757575  Labels, captions, secondary info  
--border  #E0E0E0  Card borders, dividers  
 
3.3 Layout Structure  
The application layout follows a standard dashboard pattern with three zones:  
Safcha Internal Dashboard — Technical Specification  
Confidential — Page 8  
• Left Sidebar (240px fixed): Dark background (#1A1A2E). Contains Safcha logo, 
navigation grouped by module category, user avatar and role at the bottom. Collapsible 
to icon -only (64px) mode.  
• Top Header Bar (64px fixed): Contains page title/breadcrumbs, global search bar, 
notification bell with badge count, language toggle (EN/AR), and user menu dropdown.  
• Main Content Area (fluid): Scrollable. Uses a max -width container (1400px) ce ntered 
with padding. Content is arranged in responsive card grids.  
 
3.4 Sidebar Navigation Structure  
The sidebar should group navigation items by business function. Each group is collapsible. 
Active item gets a gold accent bar on the left edge. Navigation groups:

3.5 Component Library  
Build a shared component library in /components/ui that is reused across all modules. This 
ensures visual consistency and speeds development. Core components:  
 
Component  Description  States  
KPICard  Metric card with value, trend arrow, 
comparison %  Loading, normal, positive, 
negative, neutral

3.6 Interaction Patterns  
• Click row to open detail: All table rows are clickable. Opens a slide -in drawer (not a 
new page) for quick viewing. Full page available via “Open” button in drawer.  
• Inline editing: Status changes, quick notes, and simple fields should be editable inline 
without opening a form.  
• Keyboard shortcuts: Cmd+K for global search, Cmd+N for new record, Escape to 
close drawers/modals.  
• Toast notifications: Bottom -right corner. Au to-dismiss after 4 seconds. Types: success 
(green), error (red), warning (gold), info (blue).  
• Loading states: Skeleton screens for initial loads, inline spinners for actions, optimistic 
UI for quick updates.  
• Confirmation dialogs: Required for any delete ac tion. Use a clear destructive -action 
button (red) with explicit confirmation text.

Confidential — Page 37 DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP  
 
7. Development Roadmap  
Recommended phased approach to building the dashboard:  
 
7.1 Phase 1: Foundation + Sales & Inventory (Weeks 1 -4) 
• Week 1: Project setup (Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Auth), sidebar navigation, layout 
shell, user roles  
• Week 2: Sales & Orders module (order CRUD, list view, detail drawer, status workflow)  
• Week 3: Inventory module (raw materials, finished products, stock movement s, alerts)  
• Week 4: Connect Sales → Inventory flow, basic CEO Dashboard KPIs  
 
7.2 Phase 2: Finance + Production (Weeks 5 -7) 
• Week 5: Finance module (revenue from orders, expense tracking, P&L view)  
• Week 6: Production module (batches, QC, R&D tracker)  
• Week 7: Connect Production → Inventory flow, Finance auto -population, CEO 
Dashboard charts  
 
7.3 Phase 3: CRM + Products + Team (Weeks 8 -10) 
• Week 8: CRM (contacts, companies, deals pipeline Kanban)  
• Week 9: Product Catalog (products, variants, pricing tiers) , Team & Tasks (task board, 
projects)  
• Week 10: Connect CRM → Sales flow, wholesale/export management sub -views  
 
7.4 Phase 4: Marketing + Events + Docs + Strategy (Weeks 11 -13) 
• Week 11: Marketing (campaigns, ad budget, content calendar)  
• Week 12: Events & Ex pos (event records, event inventory, lead capture)  
• Week 13: Document Vault, Strategy & OKRs, Settings & Admin, data migration from 
Notion  
 
7.5 Phase 5: Polish & Launch (Weeks 14 -16) 
• Week 14: Full CEO Dashboard with all data sources connected, global search , 
notifications system  
Safcha Internal Dashboard — Technical Specification  
Confidential — Page 38 • Week 15: Arabic language support (RTL), mobile responsiveness, performance 
optimization  
• Week 16: User acceptance testing, data migration verification, team training, go -live 
 
7.6 Estimated Total Timeline  
Approximately 16 weeks (4 mon ths) for a single developer. This can be compressed to 10 -12 
weeks with parallel development or by using a low -code backend like Supabase with pre -built UI 
components.
